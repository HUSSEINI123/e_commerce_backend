This GitHub repo continues from the Novamessis (farm_to_table) project, addressing limited access to fresh/local food in urban areas. It expands to include various products and connects consumers with producers, enabling direct purchases. Backend/database (NoSQL-MongoDB) focus. Frontend coming soon. Thank you
